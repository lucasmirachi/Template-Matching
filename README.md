# Template-Matching using OpenCV
 A template matching program I developed using OpenCV.

Template matching is one of the simplest form of object detection, where it simply scans a larger image for a provided template by sliding the template target image across the larger image. It is important to keep in mind that this will only work with a "perfect match" while using correlation.
